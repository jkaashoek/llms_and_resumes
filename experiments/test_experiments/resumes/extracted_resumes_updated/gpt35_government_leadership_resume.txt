To improve this resume, I would suggest the following: 1. Add a professional summary at the beginning to highlight key skills and experiences. 2. Use bullet points for easier readability in the Education, Internship Experience, Leadership Experience, and Additional Work Experience sections. 3. Quantify achievements where possible to showcase impact, such as 'Negotiated student scholarship program serving 15 students per year.' 4. Consider adding a Skills section to highlight relevant skills like communication, leadership, and language proficiency. 5. Ensure consistency in formatting and spacing throughout the resume for a polished look.
