To improve this resume, consider restructuring the sections for better readability. Start with a professional summary highlighting key skills and experiences. Then, list education, relevant coursework, internship experience, leadership experience, and additional work experience in separate sections. Highlight achievements and quantify results where possible. Also, consider adding a skills section to showcase specific competencies. Lastly, ensure consistency in formatting and use bullet points for easy scanning.
