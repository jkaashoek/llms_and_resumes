To improve this resume, consider restructuring the sections to highlight the most relevant information first. Start with a Summary section that provides a brief overview of your qualifications and key achievements. Follow this with sections on Education, Experience, Skills, and Honors & Awards. Use bullet points to make the information easier to read and highlight key accomplishments in each role. Additionally, consider adding a Skills section to showcase your relevant skills such as leadership, communication, and legal research. Make sure to tailor the resume to the specific job you are applying for by including keywords from the job description.
