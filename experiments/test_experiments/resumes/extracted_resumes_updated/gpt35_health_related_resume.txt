To improve the resume, I would suggest the following changes:
1. In the Objective section, be more specific about the skills and experiences you want to bring to the internship at Velocity Sports Performance Group.
2. Under Education, include any relevant coursework or projects that highlight your skills in exercise science and sports medicine.
3. In the Shadowing Experience section, provide more details about your observations and key takeaways from each shadowing opportunity.
4. For the Research Experience, emphasize any significant findings or outcomes from your work in the Non-Invasive Exercise Muscle Physiology Lab.
5. In the Leadership Experience, quantify your achievements where possible (e.g., percentage increase in club membership, specific fundraising goals achieved).
6. Consider adding a Skills section to highlight specific technical skills or certifications relevant to exercise science and sports medicine.
