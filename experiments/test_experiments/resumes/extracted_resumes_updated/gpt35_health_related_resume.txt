To improve the resume, I would recommend the following changes:
1. Add a professional summary at the beginning to provide a quick overview of your qualifications and goals.
2. Reformat the sections for better readability with bullet points and concise descriptions.
3. Quantify achievements where possible, such as the amount raised during fundraising efforts.
4. Include relevant keywords from the job description to tailor the resume to the internship at Velocity Sports Performance Group.
5. Consider adding a skills section to highlight specific abilities related to exercise science and sports medicine.
6. Proofread for any typos or grammatical errors to ensure a polished final version.
