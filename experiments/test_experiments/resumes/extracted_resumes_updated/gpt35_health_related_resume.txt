To improve this resume, I would recommend the following changes:
1. Add a summary section at the beginning highlighting key skills and experiences.
2. Specify the internship position at Velocity Sports Performance Group in the objective statement.
3. Include bullet points under each experience section for better readability.
4. Quantify achievements where possible (e.g., number of patients assisted, funds raised).
5. Consider adding a skills section to showcase relevant technical skills.
6. Ensure consistency in formatting and use action verbs to start each bullet point.
7. Proofread for any grammatical errors or typos.
