To improve the resume, I would suggest restructuring it with clear section headings and bullet points for easy readability. I would also recommend adding a professional summary at the beginning to highlight key qualifications and skills. Additionally, I would focus on quantifying achievements and results in the relevant experience section to showcase impact. Finally, I would suggest including any certifications or relevant volunteer work to enhance the overall profile.
