To improve the resume, I would suggest the following changes:
1. Revise the SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS section to include specific quantifiable achievements or outcomes from project management and team building experiences.
2. Consider adding a Skills section to highlight key technical skills and tools in a more organized manner.
3. Enhance the EDUCATION section by including any relevant coursework projects or academic achievements.
4. Provide more details and accomplishments in the relevant experience sections to showcase the impact of your roles.
5. Consider adding a section for Certifications or Professional Development to highlight any additional qualifications.
6. Ensure consistency in formatting and use bullet points for easy readability throughout the resume.
