To improve this resume, I would suggest the following changes:
1. Add a professional summary at the beginning that highlights key achievements and skills.
2. Organize the relevant experience section by listing the most recent experience first.
3. Quantify achievements where possible to showcase impact.
4. Consider adding any certifications or professional development courses.
5. Ensure consistency in formatting and use bullet points for easier readability.
