To improve the resume, I would suggest restructuring the content to make it more concise and impactful. Consider organizing the sections in a more structured format with clear headings. Additionally, focus on quantifying achievements and responsibilities to showcase tangible results. Utilize action verbs to begin each bullet point and highlight key accomplishments. Make sure to proofread for any spelling or grammatical errors. Overall, the resume could benefit from a more polished and professional appearance to grab the attention of potential employers.
