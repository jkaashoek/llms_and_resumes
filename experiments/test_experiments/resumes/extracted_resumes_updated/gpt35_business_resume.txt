The resume provided has a strong foundation but can be improved by restructuring the sections for better readability. Consider moving the 'Relevant Experience' section above 'Education' to highlight your professional background first. Additionally, quantify your achievements in each role to showcase your impact. Use bullet points for a clearer presentation of your responsibilities and accomplishments. Lastly, include a 'Summary' section at the beginning to provide a brief overview of your key skills and experiences.
