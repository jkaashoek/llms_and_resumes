To improve the resume, I suggest the following changes:
1. Include a professional summary at the beginning highlighting key skills and experiences.
2. Use bullet points to make the information more concise and easier to read.
3. Quantify achievements where possible to showcase impact.
4. Consider reorganizing sections for better flow, such as moving Technical Skills higher up on the resume.
5. Use action verbs to start each bullet point in the work experience section.
6. Provide more details about the impact of projects and experiences, focusing on results.
7. Ensure consistency in formatting and style throughout the resume.
Overall, these improvements will help make the resume more compelling and impactful for potential employers.
