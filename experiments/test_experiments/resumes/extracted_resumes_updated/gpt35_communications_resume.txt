To improve this resume, I would suggest the following: 1. Remove unnecessary personal information such as Instagram handle and personal website. 2. Reformat the resume to make it more visually appealing and easier to read. 3. Quantify achievements where possible, such as specifying the exact increase in web traffic or number of followers gained. 4. Use bullet points to highlight key responsibilities and accomplishments in each role. 5. Consider adding a summary or objective section at the beginning to provide a brief overview of the candidate's skills and goals.
